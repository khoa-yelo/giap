# Backlog

Issues may live on GitHub; this file mirrors the milestone plan (GIAP_SPEC.md §13).

- [ ] M0 scaffold (in progress)
- [ ] M1 inputs and preflight
- [ ] M2 annotation wrappers, full Bakta DB, recorded fixtures
- [ ] M3 mapping and decoy FDR; pilot kit
- [ ] M4 gene table, detectability, region tests
- [ ] M5 autocorrelation and islands
- [ ] M6 operons; RegulonDB calibration (source currently unreachable)
- [ ] M7 variants and novel ORFs (declare GIAP's VCF FILTER values with descriptions; M1-05 writes generic ones)
- [ ] M8 function and determinants
- [ ] M9 visualisation and report
- [ ] M10 pilot validation
- [ ] M11 release 1.0

- M3: `mapping.tolerant.swaps` and `mapping.tolerant.mass_equivalents` config keys are not consumed by M3-07; decide which issue implements them or remove them (from M3-07 review, PR #48).
- M6: the simulator plants stop-codon readthrough (C-terminal extensions, ADR-0013) for cterm_extension calibration (from M3-19 test-author note).
- M2-09: antiSMASH databases with `url: "image"` (databases bundled in the image) — setup edge case from M2-08 review.
- M2-09 (from M2-08 review, low): delete the geNOMAD tarball after unpacking (§3.9); reject non-200 responses before hashing; cap redirects; test `_provenance` requires prev status ok; drop redundant tar `filter` weakening check.
- M4: migrate existing calibration tests to `_criteria.calibrate()` so ADR-0015 two-block confirmation and sharding apply to all suites (M4-05 decision 7; test-author).
